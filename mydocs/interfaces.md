Designing different views for **customers**, **agents**, and **admins** generally involves:

1. **Role-Based Access** – Ensuring each user only sees what they need to see.  
2. **Task-Focused Interfaces** – Tailoring the UI to the tasks of each role.  
3. **Scalable Permission Model** – Letting the system adapt as more granular permission needs arise.

Below is a breakdown of how you can structure views and permissions for each role.

---

## 1. Customer (End User) Views

### a. **Home / Dashboard**  
- **My Tickets**: A list or dashboard of all tickets created by the user.  
  - Status indicators (Open, In Progress, Closed).  
  - Basic ticket details (Subject, Created Date, Last Update, Priority).  
- **Quick Actions**: A prominent “Create New Ticket” button.  
- **Notifications**: Alerts for ticket status changes or agent replies.

### b. **Ticket Detail View**  
- **Conversation Timeline**: Customer can see the full conversation, including replies from support.  
- **Add Reply** (Rich Text or simple text box).  
- **Attachments**: Upload files to clarify issues.  
- **Status Indicator**: Current ticket status (e.g., Open, Awaiting Customer, Closed).  
- **Self-Service & Help Articles** (optional, but helpful): Show recommended KB articles or self-help suggestions based on the ticket subject/tags.

### c. **Profile / Settings**  
- **Account Details**: Name, email, password change.  
- **Notification Preferences**: Email, SMS, push (if enabled).

### d. **Knowledge Base** (Self-Service)  
- **Search Bar**: Look up articles, FAQs.  
- **Article/FAQ Categories**: Organized by topic.  
- **View Article**: Detailed instructions, possible embedded media or step-by-step guides.  
- **Feedback/Ratings**: Thumbs-up/down or star rating to evaluate articles.

**Key Notes for Customer View**:  
- **Minimal Complexity**: Focus on a clear, user-friendly layout with top-level functionality.  
- **Limited Control**: Customers can’t change ticket assignments, statuses, or see internal notes.  
- **Mobile-Responsive**: Many users will interact from a mobile device, so ensure design is responsive.

## 2. Agent (Support Employee) Views

### a. **Agent Dashboard / Queue**  
- **Ticket Queue**: Lists tickets assigned to the agent (or to their team if using a pooled approach).  
  - **Filters**: By priority, status, tags, date.  
  - **Bulk Actions**: Close multiple tickets, re-assign, etc.  
- **Performance Metrics (Individual)**: Quick stats on tickets resolved, average response time, etc.

### b. **Ticket Detail View (Agent Perspective)**  
- **Conversation Thread**: Includes both public replies and private internal notes (not visible to the customer).  
- **Rich Text Editor** for replies: Agents can attach files, insert canned responses, etc.  
- **Internal Notes**: Agents can post private notes or mention other team members.  
- **Ticket Properties**: Current status, priority, assigned team or agent, tags, custom fields (e.g. product version).  
- **Macro / Template Insertion**: Agents can quickly insert standard replies for known issues.  
- **Customer Info**: Quick access to the user’s profile and past tickets to provide context.

### c. **Collaboration Tools**  
- **@Mentions** in Internal Notes: Notify specific colleagues.  
- **Tagging** or categorization: Agents can add or remove tags to help with reporting or routing.

### d. **Search & Filtering**  
- **Global Search**: Search across tickets, customers, knowledge base.  
- **Advanced Filtering**: By assigned agent, team, creation date, tags, etc.

### e. **Optional AI/Automation Integrations**  
- **Suggested Articles**: The system may recommend knowledge base articles that agents can insert into replies.  
- **Auto-Classifications**: Indications of potential ticket type or next steps.

## 3. Admin Views

### a. **Admin Dashboard**  
- **System-Level Stats**:  
  - Overall ticket volume, average resolution time, response time, customer satisfaction scores.  
  - Top performing agents, busiest teams, trending issues (tags).  
- **Real-Time Activity Feed**: See the latest tickets created, assigned, or escalated.

### b. **Team & Employee Management**  
- **Team Setup**: Create or update teams (e.g. “Billing,” “Technical Support”).  
- **Invite/Remove Agents**: Manage employee accounts, assign roles (agent, supervisor, admin).  
- **Skill-based Routing Rules**: Set rules for auto-assignments based on keywords, tags, or custom fields.  
- **Coverage Schedules**: Define shift schedules and on-call rotations if needed.

### c. **Configuration & Settings**  
- **Ticket Settings**: Define custom fields, statuses, priorities.  
- **Notification Rules**: Configure how and when notifications are sent (email, Slack, etc.).  
- **Webhook Management**: Set up outbound webhooks for external services.  
- **Branding / Customer Portal**: Customize the look-and-feel, domain, or theme.

### d. **Reporting & Analytics**  
- **Advanced Reports**:  
  - Ticket trends over time (created vs. resolved).  
  - SLA compliance (first response time, resolution time).  
  - Customer satisfaction ratings, feedback comments.  
- **Export Data**: Ability to export reports or raw data as CSV, PDF, etc.  
- **Audit Trails**: Visibility into changes made by users/agents (audit logs).

### e. **Security & Access Controls**  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Create groups/roles with specific permissions.  
- **System Logs**: Track login attempts, suspicious activity, or advanced security settings (2FA).  
- **Backup & Archival Settings**: Database backups, automatic archival of old tickets.

## 4. Combining Views with Role-Based Permissions

Under the hood, you’ll likely have a **single-page application (SPA)** or server-rendered application that dynamically adjusts the visible menu items and pages based on a user’s role. For instance:

- **Customers** (role: `customer`):
  - **Allowed**: Access to the “Customer Portal” area (ticket submission, knowledge base, ticket history, profile).  
  - **Not Allowed**: Access to agent-specific or admin pages.

- **Agents** (role: `agent`):
  - **Allowed**: Ticket queues, ticket detail with collaboration tools, knowledge base authoring, personal reporting metrics.  
  - **Not Allowed**: Team management, system configurations, advanced analytics.

- **Admins** (role: `admin` or `superadmin`):
  - **Allowed**: Full access to all pages. Can manage teams, employees, system settings, reporting, etc.

You can implement these **visibility rules** in multiple ways:
1. **Frontend Routing** – Checking user role before allowing route access.  
2. **Backend Role Enforcement** – The API returns only the data or endpoints that each role can access.  
3. **UI Conditionals** – Show/hide UI elements based on the user’s permissions.

## 5. Visual Example of Layout Structures

Below are rough ideas of how navigation might be structured:

### Customer Portal Layout
```
-------------------------------------------------
[Logo]  [Home]  [My Tickets]  [Knowledge Base]  [Profile]
-------------------------------------------------
|              Content Area                      |
|  - List of tickets or article search           |
-------------------------------------------------
```

### Agent Console Layout
```
-------------------------------------------------
[Company Logo]  [My Queue]  [All Tickets]  [Reports]  [Profile]
-------------------------------------------------
|   Sidebar Filters   |        Ticket List / Details / Chat       |
|                     |                                           |
-------------------------------------------------
```

### Admin Dashboard Layout
```
---------------------------------------------------------------
[Logo] [Dashboard] [Teams] [Users] [Settings] [Reports/Analytics]
---------------------------------------------------------------
|  Large analytics panels (ticket volume, agent performance, etc.)
|  Possibly real-time feed of new or escalated tickets
|
---------------------------------------------------------------
```

## 6. Tips & Best Practices

1. **Modular UI Components**  
   - Reuse components like ticket lists and ticket detail panels across user roles, but hide or disable features if the role is not authorized.

2. **Granular Permissions**  
   - Consider that some agents might have limited permissions (like not being able to delete tickets or change advanced settings). This can be handled by grouping permissions (e.g., “ticket:read”, “ticket:write”, “ticket:assign”, etc.).

3. **Responsive Design & Accessibility**  
   - Make sure each view is mobile-friendly (especially for customers).
   - Follow accessibility standards (WCAG) so that users with assistive technologies can navigate the UI.

4. **Contextual Help & Onboarding**  
   - For admin pages with complex settings, embed tooltips or short help text.
   - Agents might benefit from a guided tour when they first log in.

5. **Scalability for Larger Orgs**  
   - As the support team grows, the UI for admins might include more robust search or grouping of employees, advanced routing rules, or departmental segmentation.

### Summary

- **Customers** need **simple, self-service** pages: create/view tickets, knowledge base, and a short, clear path to get help.  
- **Agents** need **robust ticket management** and collaboration tools.  
- **Admins** require **system-wide controls**, analytics, and configuration capabilities.

By separating interfaces based on user roles (customer, agent, admin), you ensure each group has the features and data they need—without overcomplicating the UI or exposing sensitive functionality to unauthorized users.
