# AI Features Implementation Checklist

## Initial Setup & Infrastructure

- [x] Set up LangSmith/LangFuse for monitoring
  - [x] Create accounts and obtain API keys
  - [x] Configure environment variables in `.env` and `.env.local`
  - [x] Set up tracing middleware for all AI interactions

- [*] Configure Next.js API Routes for AI Features
  - [x] Set up development environment for API routes
  - [*] Create necessary middleware for API key validation (using existing Supabase Auth)
  - [*] Implement rate limiting and error handling middleware (defer for post-MVP)

## Step 0: API Testing & Verification

- [x] Basic API Integration Tests
  - [x] Create simple LangChain chain with basic prompt
  - [x] Test OpenAI API connectivity
  - [x] Verify LangSmith/LangFuse logging
  - [x] Test Next.js API route with dummy endpoint
  - [x] Create basic end-to-end test with frontend integration

- [x] Environment Verification
  - [x] Verify all required API keys are properly set
  - [*] Test rate limiting configuration (defer for post-MVP)
  - [*] Verify error handling works as expected (basic error handling only for MVP)
  - [x] Check monitoring dashboard accessibility
